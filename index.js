	"If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you're needing is not to be in a different place, but to be a different person.",
	"Until we have begun to go without them, we fail to realize how unnecessary many things are. We’ve been using them not because we needed them, but because we had them",
	"Enjoy present pleasures in such a way as not to injure future ones",
	"If you live in harmony with nature you will never be poor. If you live according to what others think, you will never be rich",
	"Regard a friend as loyal and you will make him loyal",
	"When you are looking on anyone as a friend when you do not trust him as you trust yourself, you are making a grave mistake, and have failed to grasp sufficiently the full force of true friendship.",
	"It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more.",
	"Limiting one’s desires actually helps to cure one of fear. ‘Cease to hope and you will cease to fear.’ Widely different as fear and hope are, the two of them march in unison like a prisoner and the escort he is handcuffed to. Fear keeps pace with hope, both belong to a mind in suspense, to a mind in a state of anxiety through looking into the future. Both are mainly due to projecting our thoughts far ahead of us instead of adapting ourselves to the present.",
	"Nothing is burdensome if taken lightly, and nothing need arouse one’s irritation so long as one doesn’t make it bigger than it is by getting irritated.",
	"Of this one thing make sure against your dying day that your faults die before you do.",
	"What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.",
	"You should live in such a way that there is nothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself.",
	"What really ruins our character is the fact that none of us looks back over his life.",
 	"Philosophy calls for simple living, not for doing penance, and the simple way of life need not be a crude one.",
	"For many men, the acquisition of wealth does not end their troubles, it only changes them",
	"There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with",
	"Withdraw into yourself, as far as you can. Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn while they teach.",
	"I have learned to be a friend to myself, great improvement this indeed, such a one can never be said to be alone for know that he who is a friend to himself is a friend to all mankind",
	"Each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day.",
	"What fortune has made yours is not your own.",
	"A woman is not beautiful when her ankle or arm wins compliments, but when her total appearance diverts admiration from the individual parts of her body.",
	"To be everywhere is to be nowhere.",
	"Wild animals run from the dangers they actually see, and once they have escaped them  theyworry no more. We however are tormented alike by what is past and what is to come. A number of our blessings do us harm, for memory brings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely. No one confines his unhappiness to the present.",
	"People who know no self-restraint lead stormy and disordered lives, passing their time in a state of fear commensurate with the injuries they do to others, never able to relax.",
	"Let us say what we feel, and feel what we say; let speech harmonize with life.",
	"Difficulty comes from our lack of confidence.",
	"The only safe harbor in this life's tossing troubled sea, is to refuse to be bothered about what the future will bring and to stand ready and confident, squaring the breast to take without skulking or flinching whatever fortune hurls at us.",
	"To expect punishment is to suffer it; and to earn it is to expect it.",
	 "As it is with a play, so it is with life - what matters is not how long the acting lasts, but how good it is.",
	"All this hurrying from place to place won’t bring you any relief, for you’re traveling in the company of your own emotions, followed by your troubles all the way.",
	"Words need to be sown like seeds. No matter how tiny a seed may be, when in lands in the right sort of ground it unfolds its strength and from being minute, expands and grows to a massive size.",
	"When a mind is impressionable and has none too firm a hold on what is right, it must be rescued from the crowd: it is so easy for it to go over to the majority.",
	"Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die. ",
	"Preserve a sense of proportion in your attitude to everything that pleases you, and make the most of them while they are at their best.",
	"There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.",
	"Men do not care how nobly they live, but only how long, although it is within the reach of every man to live nobly, but within no man's power to live long.",
	"It is a great man that can treat his earthenware as if it was silver, and a man who treats his silver as if it was earthenware is no less great.",
	"An unpopular rule is never long maintained.",
	"However much you possess there's someone else who has more, and you'll be fancying yourself to be short of things you need to exact extent to which you lag behind him.",
	"Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner. Food does no good and is not assimilated into the body if it leaves the stomach as soon as it is eaten; nothing hinders a cure so much as frequent change of medicine; no wound will heal when one salve is tried after another; a plant which is often moved can never grow strong. There is nothing so efficacious that it can be helpful while it is being shifted about. And in reading of many books is distraction.",
	"A guilty person sometimes has the luck to escape detection, but never to feel sure of it.",
	"Desultory reading is delightful, but to be beneficial, our reading must be carefully directed.",
	"Soft living imposes on us the penalty of debility; we cease to be able to do the things we've long been grudging about doing.",
	"Some things torture us more than they ought, some before they ought, and some which ought never to torture us at all. We heighten our pain either by presupposing a cause or anticipation",
	"The more a mind takes in the more it expands.",
	"Life is slavery if the courage to die is absent.",
	"I never spend a day in idleness; I appropriate even a part of the night for study. I do not allow time for sleep, but yield to it when I must, and when my eyes are wearied with waking and ready to fall shut, I keep them at their task.",
	"Every day as it comes should be welcomed and reduced forthwith into our own possession as if it were the finest day imaginable. What flies past has to be seized at.",
	"The boon that could be given can be withdrawn.",
	"It is uncertain where Death will await you; there expect it everywhere.",
	"Barley porridge, or a crust of barley bread and water do not make a very cheerful diet, but nothing gives one keener pleasure than having the ability to derive pleasure even from that- and the feeling of having arrived at something which one cannot be deprived of by any unjust stroke of fortune.",
	"If you look on wealth as a thing to be valued you’ll always fancy yourself to be short of the things you need to the extent to which you lag behind what others have.",
	"Nothing, Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who will can oust us from possession.",
	"Humanity is the quality which stops one being arrogant towards one's fellows, or being acrimonious.",
	"For love of bustle is not industry, it is only the restlessness of a hunted mind.",
	"There are a few men whom slavery holds fast, but there are many more who hold fast to slavery.",
	"We are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed, Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.",
	"Philosophy teaches us to act, not to speak;",
	"If I had not been admitted to these studies it would not have been worth while to have been born.",
	"Prove, and an easy task it is, that so-called pleasures, when they go beyond a certain limit, are but punishments.",
	"No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him. Do not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed.",
	"Anyone who likes may make things easier for himself by viewing them with equanimity.",
	"You shall be told what pleased me to-day in the writings of Hecato; it is these words: What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself. That was indeed a great benefit; such a person can never be alone. You may be sure that such a man is a friend to all mankind.",
	"No man is good by accident. Virtue has to be learnt.",
	"If you look on wealth as a thing to be valued your imaginary poverty will cause you torment.",
	"Cling, therefore, to this sound and wholesome plan of life; indulge the body just so far as suffices for good health. Your food should appease your hunger, your drink quench your thirst, your clothing keep out the cold, your house be a protection against inclement weather. It makes no difference whether it is built of turf or variegated marble imported from another country: what you have to understand is that thatch makes a person just as good a roof as gold.",
	"Possession of a friend should be with the spirit: the spirit's never absent: it sees daily whoever it likes.",
	"If you have nothing to stir you up and rouse you to action, nothing which will test your resolution by its threats and hostilities; if you recline in unshaken comfort, it is not tranquility; it is merely a flat calm.",
	"Believe me if you consult philosophy she will persuade you not to lit so long at your counting desk",
	"And when the soul has yielded to pleasure, its functions and actions grow weak, and any undertaking comes from a nerveless and unsteady source.",
	"If he lose a hand through disease or war, or if some accident puts out one or both of his eyes, he will be satisfied with what is left, taking as much pleasure in his impaired and maimed body as he took when it was sound. But while he does not pine for these parts if they are missing, he prefers not to lose them. 5. In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I say can, I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.",
	"The day has already begun to lessen. It has shrunk considerably, but yet will still allow a goodly space of time if one rises, so to speak, with the day itself. We are more industrious, and we are better men if we anticipate the day and welcome the dawn.",
	"Now all men suffer from ignorance of the truth; deceived by common report, they make for these ends as if they were good, and then, after having won their wish, and suffered much, they find them evil, or empty, or less important than they had expected.",
	"What is freedom, you ask?  It means not being a slave to any circumstance, to any constraint, to any chance; it",
	"Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment ourselves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past. Many of our blessings bring bane to us; for memory recalls the tortures of fear, while foresight anticipates them. The present alone can make no man wretched.",
	"I wish Lucilius you had been so happy as to have taken this resolution long ago I wish we had not deferred to think of an happy life till now we are come within light of death But let us delay no longer",
	"What is my object in making a friend? To have someone to be able to die for, someone I may follow into exile, someone for whose life I may put myself up as security and pay the price as well. The thing you describe is not friendship but a business deal, looking to the likely consequences, with advantage as its goal.",
	"What difference does it make, after all, what your position in life is if you dislike it yourself?",
	"Therefore, my dear Lucilius, begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life. He who has thus prepared himself, he whose daily life has been a rounded whole, is easy in his mind;",
	"If we do not want to be overwhelmed and struck numb by rare events as if they were unprecedented ones; fortune needs envisaging in a thoroughly comprehensive way.",
	"But it is one thing to remember, another to know. Remembering is merely safeguarding something entrusted to the memory; knowing, however, means making everything your own; it means not depending upon the copy and not all the time glancing back at the master.",
	"The primary indication, to my thinking, of a well-ordered mind is a man's ability to remain in one place and linger in his own company.",
	"He who needs riches least, enjoys riches most.",
	"But consider whether you may not get more help from the customary method than from that which is now commonly called a breviary, though in the good old days, when real Latin was spoken, it was called a summary.",
	"Similarly, too rich a soil makes the grain fall flat, branches break down under too heavy a load, excessive productiveness does not bring fruit to ripeness.",
	"When one is busy and absorbed in one's work, the very absorption affords great delight; but when one has withdrawn one's hand from the completed masterpiece, the pleasure is not so keen.",
	"What’s the use of overcoming opponent after opponent in the wrestling or boxing rings if you can be overcome by your temper?",
	"A good man will not waste himself upon mean and discreditable work or be busy merely for the sake of being busy.",
	"What is death? Either a transition or an end. I am not afraid of coming to an end, this being the same as never having begun, nor of transition, for I shall never be in confinement quite so cramped anywhere else as I am here.",
	"By overloading the body with food you strangle the soul and render it less active.",
	"Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends. And the same thing must hold true of men who seek intimate acquaintance with no single author, but visit them all in a hasty and hurried manner.",
	"Spurn everything that is added by way of decoration and display by unnecessary labor. Relect that nothing merits admiration except the spirit, the impressiveness of which prevents it from being impressed by anything.",
	"Away with the world’s opinion of you – it’s always unsettled and divided. Away with the pursuits that have occupied the whole of your life – death is going to deliver the verdict in your case. ... It’s only when you’re breathing your last that the way you’ve spent your time will become apparent.",
	"There is but one chain holding us in fetters, and that is our love of life.",
	"Once you have rid yourself of the affliction there, though, every change of scene will become a pleasure. You may be banished to the ends of the earth, and yet in whatever outlandish corner of the world you may find yourself stationed, you will find that place, whatever it may be like, a hospitable home. Where you arrive does not matter so much as what sort of person you are when you arrive there.",
	"The man who spends his time choosing one resort after another in a hunt for peace and quiet will in every place he visits find something to prevent him from relaxing.",
	"First and foremost, we must reject pleasures; they render us weak and womanish; they make great demands upon us, and, moreover, cause us to make great demands upon Fortune. Second, we must spurn wealth: wealth is the diploma of slavery. Abandon gold and silver, and whatever else is a burden upon our richly-furnished homes; liberty cannot be gained for nothing. If you set a high value on liberty, you must set a low value on everything else.",
	"Pleasure, unless it has been kept within bounds, tends to rush headlong into the abyss of sorrow.",
	"Furthermore, if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose.",
	"We deceive ourselves in thinking that death only follows life whereas it both goes before and will follow after it for where is the difference in not beginning or ceasing to exist the effect of both is not to be",
	"No one, he says, leaves this world in a different manner from one who has just been born. That is not true; for we are worse when we die than when we were born; but it is our fault, and not that of Nature."
